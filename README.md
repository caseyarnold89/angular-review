# angular-review

### In this Project, we build an app where users can view hero cards of characters from Marvel's Avengers.

This project is used to help students at [DevMountain](devmounta.in) review some fundamental AngularJS practices, including:
- Building basic controllers and services, and passing data between them
- Using the $scope object to expose data to the DOM
- Using built in angular directives like ng-model, and ng-repeat, etc.

To view the final project, clone this repo, and then open the index page inside your favorite browser.
All the data included in this project came from the marvel api, accessible [here](http://developer.marvel.com/).
